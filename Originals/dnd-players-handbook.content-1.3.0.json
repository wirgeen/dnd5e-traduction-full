Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.</p><p>A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>"

If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your character sheet.</p><p><span><em><strong>Entering a Square.</strong></em></span> To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even more.</p><p><span><em><strong>Corners.</strong></em></span> Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature that fills its space.</p><p><span><em><strong>Ranges.</strong></em></span> To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one.

Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a class (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbFighter000000]{Fighter} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbWizard0000000]{Wizard}), a background (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbBackgroundDes.JournalEntryPage.APL7pJ7446etLuQN]{Sailor} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbBackgroundDes.JournalEntryPage.7DAvTQlrw7OTsgpX]{Acolyte}), and a species (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.8t4u8CWYbxubXflR]{Human} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.h9oGyt2Wh9mp0xbg]{Elf}. You also invent the personality and appearance of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your avatar in the D&amp;D multiverse.</p><h2>Get Ready</h2><p>Before you dive into character creation, there are a few things to do to get ready, as explained below.</p><h2>Talk with Your DM</h2><p>Start by talking with your Dungeon Master about the type of D&amp;D game they plan to run. If the DM draws inspiration from Greek myth, for example, you might choose a different direction for your character than if the DM is planning for swashbuckling on the high seas. Think about the kind of adventurer you want to play in this game. If you don’t know where to begin, look at the character illustrations in this book for inspiration.</p><h2>Choose a Character Sheet</h2><p>You’ll record the main details of your character on a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a printed character sheet (like the one shown on the following pages), a digital character sheet like the one on D&amp;D Beyond, or plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a character!</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Session Zero</h3><p>Some Dungeon Masters start a campaign with a “session zero,” an initial gathering focused on creating characters and setting expectations, including topics to avoid as well as those to embrace. A session zero provides a great opportunity to talk to the other players and the DM and decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake together.</p></aside>"

Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they aren’t evil; they are unaligned.</p></aside><h2>The Nine Alignments</h2><p>A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).</p><p>The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Good (LG).</strong></em> Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral Good (NG).</strong></em> Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Good (CG).</strong></em> Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Neutral (LN).</strong></em> Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral (N).</strong></em> Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Neutral (CN).</strong></em> Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Evil (LE).</strong></em> Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral Evil (NE).</strong></em> Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Evil (CE).</strong></em> Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust.

Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplFireball00]{Fireball}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplLightningB]{Lightning Bolt}, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplRaiseDead0]{Raise Dead}. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p><h2>Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)</h2><p>In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spell­casters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.</p><h2>Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)</h2><p>At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p>"

        "Multiclassing": {
          "name": "Multiclassing",
          "text": "<p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in a single class.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher, since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.</p><h2>Experience Points</h2><p>The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table in this chapter. For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.</p><h2>Hit Points and Hit Point Dice</h2><p>You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1.</p><p>Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice.</p><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3.</p><h2>Proficiencies</h2><p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of the new class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each class’s description in chapter 3.</p><h2>Class Features</h2><p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in each of your classes’ descriptions.</p><p>Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.</p><h3>Armor Class</h3><p>If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter’s Two Extra Attacks feature).</p><p>Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCh2ArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.rSPWZt1If4YqQSGR classes=\"right three blend-multiply\"]</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Prepared.</strong></em> You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).</p><p>Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots. </strong></em>You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:</p><ul><li>All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes</li><li>Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes</li><li>One third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (round down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or Arcane Trickster subclass.</li></ul><p>Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.</p><p>This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplBurningHan]{Burning Hands}, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.</p><p>For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3 slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells, nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance their effects.</p><p><em><strong>Pact Magic.</strong></em> If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.</p><table><caption><p>Multiclass Spellcaster: <br />Spell Slots per Spell Level</p></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Level</p></th><th><p>1</p></th><th><p>2</p></th><th><p>3</p></th><th><p>4</p></th><th><p>5</p></th><th><p>6</p></th><th><p>7</p></th><th><p>8</p></th><th><p>9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCreatingAChar.JournalEntryPage.iHbj5aJvc1T7i5YI]{chapter 2}). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its &amp;Reference[challengerating]. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.</p><p>This bonus is applied to a &amp;Reference[d20test] when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test.

Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.</p><h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2><p>Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbActions000000]{Actions} later in this chapter) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.</p><p>If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check.

There are two categories of equipment proficiency:</p><p><strong>Weapons.</strong> Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.</p><p><strong>Tools.</strong> If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have Proficiency in the skill that’s also used with that check, you have &amp;Reference[advantage] on the check too.

          "name": "Weapon Properties",
          "text": "<p>Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.</p><h3>Ammunition</h3><p>You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.</p><h3>Finesse</h3><p>When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><h3>Heavy</h3><p>You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised Weapons” in the rules glossary. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.</p></aside><h3>Light</h3><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.</p><h3>Loading</h3><p>You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.</p><h3>Reach</h3><p>A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.</p><h3>Thrown</h3><p>If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.</p><h3>Two-Handed</h3><p>A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><h3>Versatile</h3><p>A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>"

It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.</p><h2>Time-Limited Object Interactions</h2><p>When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the &amp;Reference[Utilize] action, as explained in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCombat0000000]{Combat} later in this chapter.</p><h2>Finding Hidden Objects</h2><p>When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.</p><p>If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.</p><h2>Carrying Objects</h2><p>You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require you to abide by the rules for &amp;Reference[carrying capacity].</p><h2>Breaking Objects</h2><p>As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the DM might use the rules on &amp;Reference[breaking objects] in the rules glossary.</p>"

Firelight glints off a poker beside the fireplace, and the walls are lined with ancient books. A huge painting hangs above the mantelpiece in a gilded frame. The firelight illuminates the portrait—an exact likeness of Ireena Kolyana.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as Gareth):</span> How old does the painting look?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella):</span> I’m going to check the books!</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> OK, I’ll get to those in a second.

This place is creepy!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy (as Auro):</span> I go near the fireplace. A warm fire sounds nice. But I’m also alert for danger.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">3</span></p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Got it. OK, Phillip, please make an Intelligence (History) check as Gareth looks at the painting.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>I don’t have proficiency in History, but here goes. I got—oh! A 20! For a total of … 20.</p></section><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Two things leap out at Gareth about the painting. First, the woman’s clothes look old-<span class=\"No-Break\">fashioned</span>. Second, the paint is flaking in places, and the whole thing is covered by a thin layer of soot. You’d say this painting is a few centuries old.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> So maybe an ancestor of Ireena’s? Unless she’s already a vampire and this “bitten by Strahd” thing is a ruse.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Who knows? Now, Mirabella’s looking at the books?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve</span><strong>:</strong> Yeah, I pull one off the shelf at random.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> It’s a book written in Common called <em>On the Habitations of the Divine in the Celestial and Infernal Realms</em>.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell: </span>Did you just make that up?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> I’ll never tell.

That puts out the fire. Without the light from the hearth, you’re back to the magic glow of Shreeve’s sword, which casts your shadows into the room beyond. But you can see, through clouds of lingering smoke, a closed chest on the floor, surrounded by piles of coins. There are two torch sconces on the far wall—one holding an unlit torch with an intricate metal base, the other empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor is lying against that wall, with one hand at its throat and the other holding the matching torch from the empty sconce.</p></section><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy: </span>I check out the chest!</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> And the rest of you?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Gareth enters and looks at the skeleton.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> I keep watch on this side of the fireplace.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> I’m still back by the first door.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Amy, the chest seems expertly made, with elegant fittings and clawed feet.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">7</span></p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> I try to open it.

I need Auro and Gareth to make Constitution saving throws.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy: </span>Sorry, Phillip! I got an 8.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>And a 5 for Gareth.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> As you draw this gas into your lungs, you feel a chill grip you, and your bodies stiffen. You both have the Paralyzed condition!</p></section></section><section class=\"social-callouts\"><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Everyone Is Accounted For.</strong> Exploration is open-ended; the players don’t take turns moving around the dungeon the way they do in combat. But the DM frequently checks in to make sure it’s clear where everyone is and what they’re doing.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Teamwork Matters.</strong> The player characters are working toward a common goal. They move together through the dungeon and cooperate to overcome its challenges. When the characters enter the room, they explore different parts of the room. When Auro finds a secret door behind the fireplace later in the example, they come together again to examine it, and Gareth figures out how to bypass the fire. It might seem like Russell’s character wasn’t doing much, but Shreeve was protecting the group by guarding the door.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Worth Rolling with or without Proficiency.</strong> You usually have a chance of success on an ability check even if you don’t have proficiency in a relevant skill. In the example, Phillip gets a 20 without proficiency. The d20 brings many surprises to the game—surprises that the DM then interprets. <span class=\"footnote\">3</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Finding Hidden Objects.</strong> Adventure environments are full of secrets: traps, concealed doors, loose floorboards, and hidden treasures. Characters often use Wisdom checks to find things—see the Search action in the rules glossary—but sometimes they stumble on them accidentally, as Auro did here. <span class=\"footnote\">4</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Casting Spells.</strong> Many characters have the ability to cast spells, which have a huge variety of effects. Some spells are mostly useful in combat, by dealing damage or imposing conditions. Other spells have utility in exploration. If you’re playing a spellcaster, look for a mix of combat-effective and utilitarian spells to help deal with varied challenges. <span class=\"footnote\">5</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Know Your Spells!</strong> Have your <em>Player’s Handbook</em> open to the description of a spell before you cast it. Don’t expect the DM to know how your spell works, and be ready to answer any questions about it.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Vision and Light.</strong> The DM determines what the adventurers can perceive, which means being aware of light sources—like the leaping flames in the fireplace and Shreeve’s glowing sword—as well as obscuring factors like smoke and fog. See “Vision and Light” earlier in this chapter for more information. <span class=\"footnote\">6</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> A saving throw is used to see whether a creature avoids or resists something. When the chest releases toxic gas, Phillip’s and Amy’s characters make Constitution saving throws. Constitution is one of the six abilities that measure creatures’ capabilities, and it has to do with health and stamina. When they fail their saves, the gas causes them to have the Paralyzed condition. See “Conditions” later in this chapter for more information. <span class=\"footnote\">7</span></p></aside></section></div>"

For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.</p><h2>Attune during a Short Rest</h2><p>Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails.

For example, you can’t attune to more than one <em>Ring of Protection</em> at a time.</p><h2>Ending Attunement</h2><p>Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item.

These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds.</p><h2>Crew</h2><p>A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbServices00000.JournalEntryPage.6JpV8RWOi2AG8BdK]{hirelings} to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.</p><h2>Passengers</h2><p>The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.</p><h2>Damage Threshold</h2><p>If a vehicle has a &amp;Reference[damage threshold]{Damage Threshold}, it’s noted in the table.</p><h2>Ship Repair</h2><p>Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.</p><table><caption>Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Ship</p></th><th><p>Speed</p></th><th><p>Crew</p></th><th><p>Passengers</p></th><th><p>Cargo (Tons)</p></th><th><p>AC</p></th><th><p>HP</p></th><th><p>Damage Threshold</p></th><th><p>Cost</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.VBTtG9kjHNQstG0a]{Airship}</p></td><td><p>8 mph</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>300</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>40,000 GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobGalley0000]{Galley}</p></td><td><p>4 mph</p></td><td><p>80</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>500</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>30,000 GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobKeelboat00]{Keelboat}</p></td><td><p>1 mph</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>1/2</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>3,000 GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobLongship00]{Longship}</p></td><td><p>3 mph</p></td><td><p>40</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>300</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>10,000 GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobRowboat000]{Rowboat}</p></td><td><p>1½ mph</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>50 GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobSailingShi]{Sailing Ship}</p></td><td><p>2 mph</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>300</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>10,000 GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobWarship000]{Warship}</p></td><td><p>2½ mph</p></td><td><p>60</p></td><td><p>60</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>500</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>25,000 GP</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

Here’s a glimpse at what that looks like:</p><section class=\"social-example\"><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared (as Dungeon Master):</span> After your long journey, Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone—perhaps abandoned guard­houses—loom over the approach. Beyond them, you see a gaping chasm disappearing into deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, its chains creaking in the wind. Stone gargoyles stare down at you from the high walls, and a pale light spills into the courtyard from the open castle doors beyond.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as Gareth):</span> I examine the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella):</span> I want to see how sturdy the drawbridge is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> All right, one at a time. Phillip, Gareth’s looking at the gargoyles?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not just decorations?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Make an Intelligence check.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Does my Investigation skill apply?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Sure!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (rolling a d20):</span> Ugh. Seven.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>They look like decorations to you. And Maeve, Mirabella is examining the drawbridge?</p></section><p>The adventure continues from there, relying on the DM’s descriptions to set the scenes.

Here’s what players do:</p><p><strong>Make a Character. </strong>Your character is your alter ego in the fantasy world of the game. After you read this chapter, use the rules in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCreatingAChar]{chapter 2} to create your character.</p><p><strong>Team Up.</strong> Your character joins the other players’ characters to form an adventuring party. These adventurers are allies who face challenges and fantastical situations together. Each character brings distinctive capabilities, which ideally complement those of the other characters.</p><p><strong>Venture Forth.</strong> Your character’s group explores locations and events presented by the DM. You can respond to them in any way you can imagine, guided by the rules in this book. Although the DM controls all the monsters you encounter, the DM isn’t your adversary. The DM guides your party’s journey as your characters become more powerful.</p><h2>Being the Dungeon Master</h2><p>If you want to be the mastermind of the game, consider being the DM. Here’s what DMs do:</p><p><strong>Build Adventures.</strong> You prepare the adventures that the players experience. In the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, you’ll find advice for how to create adventures and even whole worlds.</p><p><strong>Guide the Story.</strong> You narrate much of the action during play, describing locations and creatures that the adventurers face. The players decide what their characters do as they navigate hazards and choose what to explore. Then you use a combination of imagination and the game’s rules to determine the results of the adventurers’ decisions.</p><p><strong>Adjudicate the Rules.</strong> You oversee how the group uses the game’s rules, making sure the rules serve the group’s fun. You’ll want to read the rest of this chapter to understand those rules, and you’ll find the rules glossary essential.</p>"

          "text": "<p>The three main pillars of D&amp;D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:</p><ol><li><strong>The Dungeon Master Describes a Scene.</strong> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, and so on).</li><li><strong>The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.</strong> Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the DM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.</li><li><strong>The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers’ Actions.</strong> Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the DM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.</li></ol><p>This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&amp;D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Exceptions Supersede General Rules</h3><p>General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say otherwise.</p><p>The game also includes elements—class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.</p></aside>"

          "text": "<p>Sometimes a session of D&amp;D is a complete game in itself (often called a “one-shot”), where you play a short adventure that lasts for just one session. More often, though, D&amp;D sessions are connected in a longer adventure that takes several sessions to complete, and adventures can be strung together into a larger narrative called a campaign.</p><p>A campaign is like a TV series, while an adventure is like a season of the series. And a game session is like a single episode—it might be self-contained, but it usually links to the larger plot if there is one.</p><h2>Adventures</h2><p>An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased (the examples of play in this chapter are inspired by a published adventure, <em>Curse of Strahd</em>). In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, such as an underground dungeon, a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city. It includes a cast of nonplayer characters controlled by the DM. Often one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.</p><p>During an adventure, the adventurers explore environments, events, and creatures presented by the DM. Battles, traps, negotiations, mysteries, and more arise during these explorations.</p><p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges and take only one session to complete. A long adventure might involve many combats, interactions, and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.</p><h2>Campaigns</h2><p>A campaign is a series of adventures with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative.</p><p>Some campaigns are episodic, where each adventure is its own tale and not much besides the player characters links it to the next one. Other campaigns involve long-running plots, a cast of recurring NPCs, and themes that span multiple adventures, leading toward a climactic conclusion.</p><p>As with adventures, a DM might create a campaign from scratch, assemble a campaign from published adventures, or mix homemade material with published material. And the campaign might take place in a world of the DM’s creation or in a published campaign setting, such as the Forgotten Realms or Greyhawk (the latter is described in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>).</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Round Down</h3><p>Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

They help determine whether characters and monsters are successful at the things they attempt.</p><h2>Dice Notation</h2><p>The dice used in D&amp;D are referred to by the letter <em>d</em> followed by the die’s number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the cube that many games use). The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like.</p><p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCh1ArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.HEU9IiUlNzn0ab4c cite=false]</p><h3>Percentile Dice</h3><p>The rules sometimes refer to a d100. While such dice exist, the common way to roll 1d100 uses a pair of ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9, known as percentile dice. One die—that you designate before rolling—gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.</p><p>Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p><h3>D3</h3><p>The same <em>d</em> notation appears in the expression “1d3,” even though it’s rare to find dice with only three sides. To simulate rolling 1d3, roll 1d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up).</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Rolling Dice in Foundry Virtual Tabletop</h3><p>You can use the dice notation described above to create inline rolls which can be clicked to roll right away no matter how many sides it has. For example, 1d3 can be represented as an inline roll like so [[/r 1d3]] that can be clicked and rolled automatically. You can learn more about how dice work in Foundry in our <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/\">Dice article</a>.</p></article></section><h2>What Are Dice For?</h2><aside class=\"notable three right\"><h3>Interpreting Die Rolls in the Story</h3><p>Part of the fun of D&amp;D is interpreting what die rolls mean in the story. The randomness that dice bring often introduces the unexpected: an expert fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other twists. When a D20 Test or another roll produces a surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun description of what happened. If you’re a player, look for opportunities to interpret your character’s die rolls and describe why things unfolded unexpectedly or even humorously.</p></aside><p>Here are the most common uses of dice in D&amp;D.</p><h3>D20 Test</h3><p>The 20-sided die (d20) is the most important die you’ll use in the game. It’s central to the core mechanic—called &amp;Reference[d20test]{D20 Tests}—the game uses to determine whether creatures succeed or fail at the things they attempt during the game (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbD20Tests00000]{D20 Tests}). You roll a d20 whenever your character tries to do something that the DM decides has a chance of both success and failure. The higher your roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.</p><h3>Damage</h3><p>The most common use for dice other than the d20 is to determine damage. When you make a successful attack roll (one kind of D20 Test), you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a Dagger uses 1d4, a Greataxe uses 1d12, and a <em>Fireball</em> spell uses 8d6.</p><h3>Random Tables</h3><p>Occasionally, you’ll see a table that uses a die roll to generate a random result. On these tables, you’ll see a die expression, such as d10 or d100, in the header of the leftmost column. Roll that die, and find the number you rolled (or a range containing that number) in that column. Read across that row for the result. For example, the Trinkets table in chapter 2 uses a d100.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Roll Tables</h3><p>Random tables in Foundry are implemented as <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/roll-tables/\">Roll Tables</a> which can be rolled directly and the result will be sent to the chat. You can check out the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.tables.RollTable.phbStartingTrink]{Trinkets} roll table as an example.</p><p>When a roll table is embedded directly in a journal entry you can click on the die icon in the top-left to roll it.</p></article></section><h3>Percentage Chances</h3><p>Sometimes you might see a rule describing a percentage chance of something happening. For example, a rule might say there is a 5 percent chance of something happening. You can determine whether that thing happens by rolling percentile dice; if the roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance (a 01 to 05, in this example), it happens.</p>"

A blazing fire in the hearth barely gives any warmth to the room. You see a man behind the counter, methodically cleaning glasses. Three older women huddle together at one table. And a handsome young man sits by himself at a corner table, sipping a glass of wine. He looks up as you enter, but the other people ignore you. “Welcome to Barovia,” he says. He holds a coin toward the bartender: “A pitcher for the visitors.” The glint of silver catches the server’s attention.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella): </span>“Thank you, friend. May we know to whom we’re indebted?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>“I am Ismark Kolyanovich, though around here, I am often called Ismark the Lesser.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell (as Shreeve):</span> “That’s unfortunate.”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>“Indeed. I hope one day to live up to my father’s example and rid myself of that title. And so, my new friends, who are you?”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy (as Auro):</span> “I’m Auro.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “Shreeve.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as Gareth):</span> “My name is Gareth.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella):</span> “I’m called Mirabella. You said your name was Kolyanovich. Are you related to Kolyan Indirovich, the burgomaster of this town?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> He looks a little surprised. He says, “Kolyan Indirovich is my esteemed father, yes.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> “Then he’s the one who summoned us!” I show him the letter that drew us here.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> I watch his reaction as he reads it.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> He reaches for the letter but pulls back before touching it. “That seal—it’s not my father’s.” , make a Wisdom (Insight) check. <span class=\"footnote\">1</span></p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Gareth got 18.</p></section><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> You notice that Ismark is trying to conceal his terror. He’s afraid to even touch the letter’s seal.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>I ask him what’s frightening him.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “Yeah, whose seal is it?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “The Devil Strahd.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “Sounds like a pleasant fellow.”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “No! He is the vampire lord of Castle Ravenloft and a plague to my sister. You must help her!”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “So Strahd wrote this letter, pretending to be the burgomaster, imploring us to come to Barovia and rescue Ireena Kolyana from a deadly affliction … which is him? Why would he do that?”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell: </span>“Why would he want us to come here?”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> “Clearly, he doesn’t think we’re a threat.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “Well, he hasn’t met us yet!”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “He’s toying with you. He delights in the destruction of all things good, like my dear sister.”</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Gareth draws closer and compassionately asks Ismark whether his sister has been bitten by the vampire. <span class=\"footnote\">2</span></p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>Please make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to see how well he responds to your pastoral manner. You have Advantage because he’s Friendly.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>Oh, good thing. My first roll was a 7, but with Advantage … ugh, not much better. Well, 10 plus 5 is 15.</p></section><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Ismark leans toward you, Gareth, with a suspicious glance at the other people in the tavern, like he’s worried they’re eavesdropping. He whispers, “The Devil Strahd desires to make Ireena his latest plaything. Twice he has visited her in the night, using his devilry to secure an invitation into the house—for he can’t enter where he isn’t invited. Twice he has bitten her, yet she clings to life. But I fear she won’t survive another visit!”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “All right, Ismark. You bought us drinks and told us about the Devil Strahd and your sister. How can we help?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “You are too kind! First, I need your help transporting Ireena to the town of Vallaki.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> “Where’s Vallaki?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “It lies to the northwest, in the heart of the valley. As the raven flies, it is less than ten miles, but the road winds among the hills and woods, and the journey takes at least five hours at speed.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “And why there?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “The town lies beyond the view of Castle Ravenloft, so I hope it’s beyond Strahd’s spies. And I have heard that Vallaki is well defended, with a wooden palisade and iron gates.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “As if such defenses would stop a vampire.”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>“Indeed. But if moving her there can keep him away from her for even a few days, we have time for the second part of our task.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell: </span>“A part where you help us?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “Yes, when I help you face the vampire!”</p></section><section class=\"social-callouts\"><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Active Roleplaying.</strong> Notice throughout the example how Russell and Amy actively roleplay their characters’ behavior. In this active approach, they speak with their characters’ voices, like an actor taking on a role. The players might even echo their characters’ body language. They still need to describe things that can’t reasonably be acted out.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Descriptive Roleplaying.</strong> Notice how Phillip describes his character’s words and action. Drawing on his mental image of his character, he says what his character does and how the character does it. If this approach is most comfortable for you, keep these things in mind:</p><ul><li>Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.</li><li>Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.</li><li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li></ul></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Ability Checks.</strong> Phillip’s character, Gareth, makes a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether he reads Ismark’s unspoken cues. Wisdom is the ability that measures perceptiveness and intuition. Insight reflects a character’s skill at reading other people’s moods and intentions. The DM set the DC at 15, which Gareth beats. With a successful Wisdom (Insight) check, Gareth gleans information that wasn’t obvious, so it wasn’t part of the DM’s earlier narration. For more information, see “Ability Scores” and “Proficiency” earlier in this chapter and the Search action in the rules glossary. <span class=\"footnote\">1</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Influencing NPCs.</strong> Gareth takes the Influence action (see the rules glossary), which characters can take to influence an NPC. It’s easier to influence an NPC who’s already disposed to help you, as Ismark is here. Ismark’s Friendly attitude gives Phillip Advantage on the roll. In this case, Advantage made the difference between success and failure. <span class=\"footnote\">2</span></p></aside></section></div>"

They live for around 750 years, and they don’t sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations.</p><p>An environment subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it grants them certain kinds of magic.

Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.</p><p>When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile}, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.</p><h3>Casting without Slots</h3><p>There are several ways to cast a spell without a spell slot:</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Rituals.</strong> Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.</p><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.equipment.Item.phbagSpellScroll]{Spell Scrolls} and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.</p><h3>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</h3><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile} using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as Magic Missile and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds}, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.</p>"

Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell.</p><h3>Verbal (V)</h3><p>A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated. The words must be uttered in a normal speaking voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a spell with a Verbal component.</p><h3>Somatic (S)</h3><p>A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must use at least one of their hands to perform these movements.</p><h3>Material (M)</h3><p>A Material component is a particular material used in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in the Components entry. These materials aren’t consumed by the spell unless the spell’s description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform Somatic components, if any.</p><p>If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use a @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.equipment.Item.phbagComponentPo]{Component Pouch} instead of providing the materials specified in the spell, or the spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you must hold it unless its description says otherwise (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000.JournalEntryPage.xIDcbjgXOndS8zRl]{chapter 6} for descriptions).</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Creating Verbal Components</h3><p>If you’d like to say a spell’s Verbal component, you may make up the words. However you make them, the goal is to create something that’s easy to say and that doesn’t mean anything in the real world. Consider this method: take the name of the spell, keep only one instance of each of its letters, and rearrange the remaining letters into words. For example, remove the second <em>l</em> from @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplFireball00]{Fireball} and rearrange the remaining letters to create <em>Ber Fila </em>or<em> Fel Bira</em>.</p></aside>"

A spell’s description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.</p><p><em><strong>A Clear Path to the Target.</strong></em> To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind Total Cover.</p><p><em><strong>Targeting Yourself.</strong></em> If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you.</p><p><em><strong>Areas of Effect.</strong></em> Some spells, such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplThunderwav]{Thunderwave}, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in the rules glossary. The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere.</p><p><em><strong>Awareness of Being Targeted.</strong></em> Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s says otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Invalid Targets.</strong></em> If you cast a spell on someone or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended.</p><p>If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC </strong>=<strong> </strong>8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h3>Attack Rolls</h3><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your spellcasting ability + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h3>Combining Spell Effects</h3><p>The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplBless00000]{Bless} on the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second <em>Bless</em> ends.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Identifying an Ongoing Spell</h3><p>You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a [[/check 15 arc]] check.</p></aside>"

          "text": "<blockquote><p>This story began 50 years ago, and you're part of it. In the 1970s, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson created a game of make-believe that fused rules with storytelling. There’d never been anything like it: a game in which each player made their own fantasy character and teamed up with their friends to go on quests. One person served as the narrator and referee—the Dungeon Master—and did everything they could to challenge and delight the other players. That game was, of course, the fi rst version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and you’re now reading its latest version.</p><p>Over the decades, millions of people have played D&amp;D, and scores of writers, game designers, and artists have made their mark on it through its various editions. When our team released the current edition in 2014, we were humbled by how many of you loved it. This revised ver- sion of it is a salute to all of you—those of you who’ve been playing D&amp;D for years, those of you who’ve contributed to the game through your feedback, and those of you who are about to experience the joy of playing it for the first time.</p><p>As a teenager, I met both Gary and Dave. I even spent an entire day with Gary, and we did what all D&amp;D fans do: share stories about our adventures in the D&amp;D multiverse. I invite you to embark on such adventures anew. Share as much laughter as you can with your friends. Use only the rules that serve your fun, and always follow your group’s bliss. So many people have been enjoying the magic of D&amp;D for half a century. Let’s keep it blazing for another 50 years!</p><p><cite>Jeremy Crawford</cite></p></blockquote>"

Dungeons &amp; Dragons invites you to play imaginary adventurers who delve into dungeons and other perilous locations together, face fearsome foes such as dragons, and build friendships forged amid fantastical dangers.</p><p>Fueled by imagination and rules, D&amp;D invites you to adopt a fantasy persona—a mighty Fighter, a cunning Rogue, a faithful Cleric, a magical Wizard, or something else—and then solve problems, fight monsters, and visit wondrous places.</p><p>There’s no winning and losing in D&amp;D, at least not the way those terms are usually understood. Together you and friends create an exciting story of adventurers who confront perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a tragic end. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the character’s player might create a new character to carry on. No matter what happens, if everyone has a good time and creates a memorable story, they all win.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Here’s what you need to play D&amp;D with one or more friends (a typical group has five people):</p><p><strong>Dungeon Master.</strong> One person takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the players’ characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM also narrates what they experience and plays the friends and foes they meet along the way. Even though the DM challenges the adventurers, the DM always strives to delight the whole group.</p><p><strong>Players.</strong> Each player creates an adventurer who teams up with the other players’ adventurers. Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple, a lava-filled mountain, or another location described by the DM. The adventurers also solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover magic items and other treasure—all while supporting each other's fun.</p><p>You also need these resources, either in physical form or on DnDBeyond.com:</p><p><em><strong>Player's Handbook.</strong></em> This book is your essential reference for the game's rules, and it guides you through making an adventurer of your own.</p><p><em><strong>Dungeon Master's</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Monster Manual</strong></em><strong>.</strong> The first of these books guides the DM through creating and running adventures, and the second holds hundreds of monsters to fill those adventures.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Learn by Watching</h3><p>A great way to learn the basics of D&amp;D is to watch people play it. The Internet offers videos of D&amp;D play that show off the tremendous range of possibilities the game offers. As you watch, pay attention to the ways that some players help make the game fun for everyone in their group. The only audience you need to entertain when you're playing D&amp;D is yourself and your group.</p></aside><p><strong>Dice.</strong> You need a set of polyhedral dice (shown in chapter 1). You can find dice like these in game stores and from online retailers. Dice-rolling apps are also available.</p><p><strong>Character Sheet.</strong> To keep track of important information about your character, you need a character sheet, which can be as simple as a piece of paper you write notes on or as feature-rich as a digital record.</p><p>The DM might also find these accessories useful:</p><p><strong>DM Screen.</strong> Many DMs like to use a screen to shield their notes and dice rolls from players. It's bad manners to peek over the screen!</p><p>Miniatures and Battle Grid. Some DMs use a battle grid and miniatures to run combat encounters, since they help everyone visualize the action. A battle grid can be anything marked out in 1-inch squares, from disposable sheets of paper to poster maps. And miniatures range from simple tokens to detailed figurines. Online maps and miniatures are also available, including on DnDBeyond.com.</p>"

Chapter 3 offers twelve classes to choose from, along with forty-eight subclasses.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCharacterOrig]{Chapter 4: Character Origins}.</strong> Background and species are key elements in defining a character's origin, which further shapes the character's abilities beyond the choice of class. Background and species options are presented in chapter 4.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbFeats00000000]{Chapter 5: Feats}.</strong> The feats in chapter 5 are special features that characters gain as part of their background and class.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Chapter 6: Equipment}.</strong> Armor, weapons, and adventuring gear are found in chapter 6.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000]{Chapter 7: Spells}.</strong> This chapter contains descriptions of the spells that spellcasters can cast.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbAppendixATheM]{Appendix A: The Multiverse}.</strong> Here you'll find an overview of the magical multiverse where D&amp;D adventures take place.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbAppendixBCrea]{Appendix B: Creature Stat Blocks}.</strong> This appendix brims with game information for creatures that certain characters can befriend or transform into.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule]{Appendix C: Rules Glossary}.</strong> The game's main rules terminology is summarized in this appendix, making it an invaluable reference during play.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>What's New in the 2024 Version?</h3><p>This is the 2024 version of the fifth edition <em>Player’s Handbook</em>. If you’ve read the 2014 version, much of this book will feel familiar, since the fundamental rules of the game are the same. But the book contains many new or redesigned elements, and the versions of things in this book replace versions from older books. Here are highlights:</p><p><strong>Streamlined Rules.</strong> The game’s rules have been streamlined and are now supported by a rules glossary.</p><p><strong>Easier Character Creation.</strong> Using chapter 2, making a character is easier than ever before.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Classes.</strong> In chapter 3, every class and subclass has been enhanced with new options. Reimagined Origins. Explored in chapter 4, a character’s origin is now defined by background and species, each of which has been redesigned.</p><p><strong>Expanded Feats.</strong> In chapter 5, feats have been redesigned, with many feats added.</p><p><strong>Upgraded Weapons, Tools, and Crafting.</strong> Mastery properties transform how weapon wielders use their weapons, and every character can enjoy new tool and crafting rules in chapter 6.</p><p><strong>Dazzling Spells.</strong> Chapter 7 bursts with new spells and old ones that have been enhanced.</p><p>If you can’t find a rule, check the index. If a rule’s name has changed from what was printed in the 2014 Player’s Handbook, the index points you to the new name. For example, if you look up Inspiration in the index, it points you to the rules for Heroic Inspiration in the rules glossary.</p></aside>"
