Their size—similar to that of a human child—helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces.</p><p>Anyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied “luck of the halflings” in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems to intervene on the halfling’s behalf. Many halflings believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charmalaine. The same gift might contribute to their robust life spans (about 150 years).</p><p>Halfling communities come in all varieties. For every sequestered shire tucked away in an unspoiled part of the world, there’s a crime syndicate like the Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.</p><p>Halflings who prefer to live underground are sometimes called strongheart halflings or stouts.

Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.</p><p>Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.</p><p>Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.</p><h2>Becoming a Sorcerer …</h2><h3>As a Level 1 Character</h3><ul><li>Gain all the traits in the Core Sorcerer Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are listed in the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSorcerer00000.JournalEntryPage.fsqRUA4acVXH4I3O#class-features]{Sorcerer Features table}.</li></ul><h3>As a Multiclass Character</h3><ul><li>Gain the Hit Point Die from the Core Sorcerer Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.
