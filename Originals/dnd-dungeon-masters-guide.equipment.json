Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p></blockquote><p>Every <em>Moonblade</em> longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a <em>Moonblade</em> that doesn’t want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse}</em> spell or similar magic. If you’re accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A <em>Moonblade</em> functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.</p><p>A <em>Moonblade</em> has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically [[/r 1d6 + 1]]). The @UUID[.ActiveEffect.o2IcKz2aAooQr7EK]{first rune} grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>Moonblade</em> an additional property.
