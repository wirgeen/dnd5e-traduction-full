If you already have Darkvision, its range is extended by 60 feet for the same duration.</p><p><strong>Positive Reinforcement.</strong> Drinking a pint of this beverage gives you Resistance to Necrotic damage for 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Sterner Stuff.</strong> For 24 hours after drinking a pint of this beverage, you automatically succeed on saving throws to avoid or end the &amp;Reference[Frightened apply=false] condition.</p><p>At the start of a Bastion turn, you can switch to one of the other options. Your DM may create new options. A pint of this magical beverage loses its magic 24 hours after it’s poured.</p><p><em><strong>Enlarging the Facility.</strong></em> You can enlarge your Pub to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, the Pub can have two magical beverages from the Pub Special list on tap at a time. A Vast Pub gains three additional hirelings, for a total of four. These new hirelings are servers.
